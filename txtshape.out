                   how    it   has progressed over the years: C++ was developed   by   Bjarne                     Stroustrup  while  working  on  his  Ph.D. thesis at Bell Labs in 1979. He               wanted      to                                 
                   create  a  dynamic  language that would allow programmers to build complex systems            with  high-level  abstractions while still providing low-level access to the             hardware.    To                                 
                   get  this  done,  he  extended  the  C language to    include  features  such as            classes,  inheritance,  abstraction, and polymorphism to make it easier to write           efficient,                                      
                       modular,  and  reusable code. Fun Fact: The widely    known   Bell  Labs  was           originally  named  Bell Telephone Laboratories, then AT&T Bell Laboratories, and       then      Bell      Labs                            
                       Innovations.        Currently,  the  labs  are named    after  its  present   parent     company as the Nokia Bell Labs. In 1983, the first version of C++ was released      to   the  public.  At  this                           
                        point,       Rick                       Mascitti also    modified the                    language name from 'C with classes' to 'C++'. It is interesting to note that       the   '++'   in   the   name                          
                                                                    represents      the   associate                operator/ increment operator which was missing in C. At this point, many        add-on features were added to                          
                         this                                                           cross-platform                  programming              language,                including                 strong  type checking, basic

                     1985,       the first                                                   edition    of    'The    C++                        Programming                          Language'             was                                           
                   published,    which                                                            became       the                               definitive                          guide  to              the language              and                 
                                  helped                                                     to  establish C++ as a                              mainstream                      programming                language.               Since     then,       
                        there      have                                                              been     several major                      releases and                standards  of  the  language.  In  1998,  C++98,  the  first international   
                                                                                                       standardized version                      of  C++, was              released.  It  included  additional libraries and various new features such as 
                     templates,                                                                   exceptions,           and                      namespaces.              In  2011, a more advanced version of the language was released, i.e. C++11 which
                    introduced     several                                                        important      features                        such      as             regular  expressions,  Regex  support,  move  semantics,  range-based for loops,
                    lambda    expressions,                                                        standard                                       threading                library,  customary  threading  library, time library, etc. This was followed by
                     C++14,  C++17, and                                                            most           recently,                      C++20.  Each               one  of  these  future  versions  of  the  language  improved  upon existing  
                    features. There have                                                           also     been  several                       ISO  standards               for   C++,  including  ISO/IEC  14882:1998  (C++98),  ISO/IEC  14882:2011
